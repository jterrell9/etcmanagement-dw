1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose of the system

To Provide artists with a space on the web where they can use Etc. Management’s services to maximize their brand’s impact.  The landing page and services pages will act as an advertisement for Etc. Management.  There will also be a registration allowing users to create an account.

By signing up for an account, they will have access to a user portal where they can utilize their purchased services.  By linking your profile to social media, this portal will provide access to the growth tools and analytics of our “Growth” service.  It will also provide a space for the user to create and request custom graphics, custom printing for merchandising, web design, and management services such as booking shows.  There will also be a section in the portal to alter the settings of the user’s account.  Each artist will also receive their own artist page showcasing them with a sophisticated page complete with artist info and mixed media.  

The website will also feature a blog authored by Elizabeth Taylor Castro.  There will also be a forum section where users can contribute to the Etc. Management community.  A “Contact Us” section will allow visitors to send emails directly to artist managers.

1.2 Scope of the system

The domain etcmanagement.info will point to a landing page that will promote Etc. Management and its services and artists.  

A registration page will allow visitors to sign up and become members.

There will be artist blogs and website forums.

An account login page will give the user access to an artist portal where the members can access their account to purchase and utilize services

There will also be special access for managers.  They will have their own manager portal where they can make the changes to the artist’s accounts.

The admin user will be able to monitor all activity, and have access to a special admin portal.

There will be a MySQL database that will hold record of all site members, site services, and purchase transactions.

An artist roster will describe the key artists that the site will promote.  The roster will include things like bookings, press kits, and general artist information.

Cookie - An HTTP cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser while the user is browsing. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information or to record the user's browsing activity.

Data/Form Validation - The process of ensuring data have undergone data cleansing to ensure they have data quality, that is, that they are both correct and useful.

OpenSSL - A software library for applications that uses the “Secure Socket Layer” in computer networking to secure communications over computer networks against eavesdropping or need to identify the party at the other end. 

Data - A set of values of subjects with respect to qualitative or quantitative variables.

Analytics - The discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in data; and the process of applying those patterns towards effective decision making.

Visual Analytics - the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces.

Personal Information - Personally identifiable information (PII), or sensitive personal information (SPI), as used in information security and privacy laws, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context.

1.6 Overview

This project will require about 350 hrs of development, testing, and training, not to mention site maintenance.  Normally a site with this kind of functionality can cost well over $10,000 and require a team of developers. StrongWares Consulting prides itself on its ability to make do with the resources at hand.  I consult with a network of like-minded developers to make sure that we are providing a top-notch, cutting edge product.

	This project is ambitious and will certainly be rewarding for all involved.  It will require deep forethought and analysis, good communication, agile principles and methodologies, and consistent follow-through.  If all goes according to plan (Milestones and Reporting) we should be able to deploy a testable version of the website by April.

2. Current system

Currently a site created with “Google Sites” is hosted at the namespace occupied by the DNS routing of the etcmanagement.info domain.  The current system does not offer the complete functionality and control desired by the client, and the design options are lackluster.  The service also requires more expertise and time than the client has to offer. 

3. Proposed system

3.1 Overview

Etc. Management has requested a web platform for their artists to access their management services.  It will feature a website that will promote Etc. Management’s services and artists.  It will also feature a blog and a community forum.
